But you're tired. One... two... three... *<reading>YAWN</reading>* ... four. There, you did it. But *yawn* now you can't stop yawning. You're so, so sleepy. Four is too high a number to count without falling asleep.\n\nBy the way! Both the reading よん and し are pretty common, but because the on'yomi reading し sounds just like the word for \"death,\" it isn't used as much. Generally when you're just counting (for example, \"1, 2, 3, 4...\"), you will use the reading し. But when you are counting things or people, you'll use よん.
