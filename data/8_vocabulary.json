    "meaning_mnemonic": "We have <kanji>night</kanji> and the noun version of \"to dawn\" (明ける). What comes when the night ends and a new day dawns? The <vocabulary>dawn</vocabulary>, of course.\n\n夜明け refers to dawn or <vocabulary>daybreak</vocabulary> in the literal sense, but it can also be used metaphorically to mean the <vocabulary>beginning</vocabulary> of something new, as in 時代の夜明け (the dawn of an era).",
    "reading_mnemonic": "This word uses the kun'yomi readings of the kanji. You know 明け because it uses the same reading as 明ける, but 夜 is a little weird because よる gets shortened to よ. Here's a mnemonic to help you remember this change:\n\nWhat are you doing when <vocabulary>dawn</vocabulary> comes each morning? Playing with your <reading>yo</reading>-yo (よ), obviously. You want to be the best yo-yoer there's ever been, so you're up with the dawn every morning, practicing your yo-yo skills while the competition sleeps.\n\nNote that in the related phrase 夜が明ける, 夜 is also often read as よ.",
