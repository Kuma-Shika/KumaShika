In cultural contexts, it also sometimes implies the act of giving a financial gift, since in Japan things are often wrapped nicely before being given — even stacks of bills.",
    "reading_mnemonic": "You never wrap things once, you always wrap them twice. And then you double that. It's a <reading>two two</reading> (つつ) wrapping technique.\n\nつつむ is the reading we want you to focus on, but it's good to know that 包む can be read as くるむ as well. くるむ is used when you wrap something up carefully and protectively, like a baby in a blanket. つつむ on the other hand, has broader use and is commonly used for wrapping things like presents.",

The meaning for the kanji is <kanji>noisy</kanji>, so the adjective version is also <vocabulary>noisy</vocabulary>.\n\n喧しい is a casual but emphatic way to say someone or something is too noisy. It's often used in Japanese comedy and variety shows, so depending on the situation there can be a playful vibe to it. You can even use it in a figurative way to describe someone who's being overly picky, fussy, or annoying about something particular (they're being \"noisy\" about insignificant details). Note that in everyday situations, you'll often just see this word written in kana as やかましい.",

You didn't learn the やかま reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help:\n\nMy <vocabulary>noisy</vocabulary> mom has earned the nickname <reading>yak-a-Ma</reading> (やかま).
