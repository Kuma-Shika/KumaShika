You can remember this because <vocabulary>as soon as</vocabulary> you get to work, you do everything really <vocabulary>quickly</vocabulary>, so your work performance is just <reading>so-so</reading> (そうそう).\n\nはやばや is for when you do something earlier than usual, like going to bed or closing up shop before the usual time.
