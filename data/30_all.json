This is the transitive version of that, and it means things like <vocabulary>to arrange something</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to gather something</vocabulary>, and <vocabulary>to align something</vocabulary>.\n\nThis one is a little tricky to understand and translate well. At its core, this verb describes the act of arranging all of the necessary things for something. But it can also describe aligning certain things in a uniform, matching manner.
