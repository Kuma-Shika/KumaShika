When combined with other words, it can also take on metaphorical meanings, such as 頭を捻る (to think hard) and 首を捻る (to puzzle over).",
    "reading_mnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYour horse happened <vocabulary>to twist</vocabulary> his ankle, and <reading>he neigh</reading>ed (ひね) in discomfort. If it were you who had twisted your ankle, you probably would have screamed or shouted an expletive or something, but it's your horse, so he neighed. Poor guy. Put some ice on that thing for him.\n\nNote that this can also be read as ねじる, though this reading is usually written in kana. While ひねる refers to general twisting — like turning or bending to the side — ねじる tends to have a nuance of twisting something multiple times, like a string or wire, often from both ends.",
