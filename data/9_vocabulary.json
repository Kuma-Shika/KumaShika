In other words, this verb is transitive, meaning it has an object. That's why it means <vocabulary>to let something pass</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to put something through</vocabulary>.\n\nThe way this verb is translated into English changes a lot depending on the noun it's paired with. For example 火を通す is literally \"to let the fire pass through\", and means \"to heat through\". 針に糸を通す is literally \"to put thread through a needle\", so means \"to thread a needle\".",
