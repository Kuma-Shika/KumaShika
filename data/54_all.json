Stop that now.\n\nWhen you think of the <vocabulary>ginkgo tree</vocabulary> meaning, think about this: Ginkgos are a favorite nesting place for <reading>ea</reading>gles (い), but evil Mrs. <reading>Chou</reading> (ちょう) likes to eat eagles AND whole ginkgo trees. She prefers eating eagles WHILE THEY'RE IN THE GINKGO TREES AND STILL ALIVE. So いちょう. Eagles and Mrs. Chou. And ginkgo trees. It's horrible to think about. Just like this reading not being jukugo.\n\nThe other reading is for the <vocabulary>ginkgo nut</vocabulary> meaning. The nut tastes like <reading>銀</reading> (ぎん) <reading>naan</reading> (なん). Mmm, soft and metallic — but still not a jukugo word. How sad for you and all Japanese learners everywhere.",
