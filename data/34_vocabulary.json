This adjective describes things that are <kanji>valuable</kanji> in a way that transcends monetary worth, so it means <vocabulary>noble</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>invaluable</vocabulary>.\n\nWhile 尊い is used for things you honor from the heart, 貴い leans toward a dignified, noble kind of value — the kind tied to high status or social rank. Because of that, you may encounter 貴い in stories about historical class systems or old social hierarchies. It doesn't appear as commonly as 尊い in modern Japanese, but you may still see it in descriptions of someone's noble presence or the sense of dignity they give off.",
    "reading_mnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. This has the same reading as 尊い (revered, noble), so if you remember that, you can read 貴い too! In case you forgot, here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nHow can you tell if someone comes from a <vocabulary>noble</vocabulary> background? Just check their <reading>toe toe</reading> (とうと). Most noble families are pretty inbred, so a lot of their members will have a big toe (the long とう) with another small toe growing out of it (short と). This is a common birth defect among inbred aristocrats. Of course, from their point of view, it's <vocabulary>invaluable</vocabulary> proof of how noble and superior they are.",

They're a very specific kind of cloth towel, which is why you'll also often encounter them with their Japanese name <vocabulary>tenugui</vocabulary>.\n\nUnlike お手拭き, which you learned about a few levels ago, 手拭い are always towels — never tissues. These thin, flat cloths are long and narrow, serving a variety of purposes beyond simply cleaning your hands. Their history is fascinating, so be sure to look them up!",
