Not sure why, but it's a great motivator for you. So you do the same when you cheer for others. When you tell them <vocabulary>Do your best</vocabulary>, you also scream <reading>baa</reading> (ば) at them.

Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. \n\nThe kanji itself means <kanji>renew</kanji>, but the verb meaning is a little different. This means <vocabulary>to grow late</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to wear on</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to deepen</vocabulary>. Think of it this way: you only renew stuff that's <em>not</em> new, after time has worn on a bit — your streaming subscriptions, your driver's license, your marriage vows. And with each renewal you feel the passage of time a little more deeply…\n\nYou'll see 更ける more often in writing, usually in reference to night or autumn, as in 夜が更ける (the night grows late) and 秋が更ける (autumn deepens).",
    "reading_mnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading.\n\nAs it starts <vocabulary>to grow late</vocabulary>, you turn into a <reading>foo</reading>l (ふ). You ever get increasingly delirious and giggly with friends as the night wears on? Yeah, you've been there. The later it gets, the more deeply foolish you become. What is that weird, late-night energy anyway?",
