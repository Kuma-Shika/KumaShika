You know this because if you're putting an end to something, you probably don't like it, so you say \"<reading>YAASS</reading>\" (やす) with a big evil grin as you let it die out.\n\nNote that 絶やす often appears in its negative form 絶やさない, because it's commonly used to describe the intent not to let something precious or important come to an end.",

The kanji itself means <kanji>savings</kanji>, so the verb vocab version means <vocabulary>to save up</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to store</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to accumulate</vocabulary> something valuable.\n\n貯める is used when you're saving up something useful over time — typically money, loyalty points, or airline miles, for example, but sometimes water and other resources too.",
    "reading_mnemonic": "This word uses the kun'yomi reading for 貯, which you haven't learned yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you out:\n\nYou have <vocabulary>to save up</vocabulary> for <reading>ta</reading>cos (た). Not only are tacos more expensive these days, you also have a horrible taco addiction that you need to plan ahead and save for every month.",
